**The Helpful Honeybee**

Honeybees are small, busy insects that live together in large groups called colonies. A bee colony can have up to 60,000 bees! 

They work together to build their home, called a hive, using a special wax that comes from their bodies.

Every bee in the colony has a special job. Worker bees fly out to collect nectar and pollen from flowers. They bring this food back to the hive to feed the other bees. 

The queen bee is the most important bee - she lays all the eggs to make new baby bees.

Bees are very important to our world because they help flowers make seeds. When bees visit flowers to collect nectar, pollen sticks to their fuzzy bodies. They carry this pollen to other flowers, helping plants grow new flowers and fruits.

**Question:** What is a group of bees living together called?`,
    correctAnswer: 'colony',
    options: ['hive', 'colony', 'swarm', 'nest'],
    explanation: 'The passage explains that "Honeybees are small, busy insects that live together in large groups called colonies." A colony is the term for a group of bees living and working together.',
